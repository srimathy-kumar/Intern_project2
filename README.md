<p align="center"> In my project, I had implemented the cloning concept in which I had used facebook cloning in name of "Friendzee" using NextJs, NextAuth, Rest API, React Hook, SpringBoot and MySQL. Facebook cloning is a scam in which attacker copies the profile picture of an authorized user, creates a new account using the person's name and send friend requests to people on the user's list. TailWindCSS is used for css styling which has in-built functionalities.Main Purpose of this project is to give facility to create community and convey the world closer together. My project helps to interact with friends by sharing images, videos and Activity/Feelings in Post.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Fully Functional E-commerce website Home Page is a responsive e-commerce website. The technologies used in this project are NextJs, TailwindCSS, NextAuth, Rest API and React Hook. There are a few important modules in the project like home page, creating post, adding/deleting the images, online/offline status of user, Like/Share/Comments. The data is accessed using Rest API and then rendered into the webpage. I took almost 40 - 50 hrs to complete this project. SkillLync helped me by providing the wire-frames for all relevant features.
