## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Fully Functional E-commerce website Home Page is a responsive e-commerce website. The technologies used in this project are NextJs, TailwindCSS, NextAuth, Rest API and React Hook. There are a few important modules in the project like home page, creating post, adding/deleting the images, online/offline status of user, Like/Share/Comments. The data is accessed using Rest API and then rendered into the webpage. I took almost 40 - 50 hrs to complete this project. SkillLync helped me by providing the wire-frames for all relevant features.
