<p align="center"> In my project, I had implemented the cloning concept in which I had used facebook cloning in name of "Friendzee" using NextJs, NextAuth, Rest API, React Hook, SpringBoot and MySQL. Facebook cloning is a scam in which attacker copies the profile picture of an authorized user, creates a new account using the person's name and send friend requests to people on the user's list. TailWindCSS is used for css styling which has in-built functionalities.Main Purpose of this project is to give facility to create community and convey the world closer together. My project helps to interact with friends by sharing images, videos and Activity/Feelings in Post.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Fully Functional E-commerce website Home Page is a responsive e-commerce website. The technologies used in this project are NextJs, TailwindCSS, NextAuth, Rest API and React Hook. There are a few important modules in the project like home page, creating post, adding/deleting the images, online/offline status of user, Like/Share/Comments. The data is accessed using Rest API and then rendered into the webpage. I took almost 40 - 50 hrs to complete this project. SkillLync helped me by providing the wire-frames for all relevant features.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory.
2. Install the required dependencies for the SpringBoot backend by running ./mvnw install or mvnw.cmd install on Windows.
3. Configure the database connection by modifying application.properties with your database information.
4. Start the SpringBoot backend by running ./mvnw spring-boot:run or mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run on Windows.
5. Navigate to the client directory and install the required dependencies for the Next.js frontend by running npm install.
6. Start the Next.js frontend by running npm run dev.
7. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.


 See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

we have to install 

Eclipse(java 17),

Visual Studio,

MySQL5,

Next-auth, 

next-react, 

react-redux, 

@reduxjs/toolkit, 

TailwindCSS, 

axios, 

eslint

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Back-End:


https://start.spring.io/

https://mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/oomph/epp/2023-03/R/eclipse-inst-jre-win64.exe

Front-End:

npx create-next-app facebook-clone

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

npx tailwindcss init -p

npm install react-icons --save

npm install --save next-auth

npm install axios

npm install react-redux

npm install @reduxjs/toolkit

npm install --save-dev eslint



## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Running the project using the following comments:

1. By clicking "java application" from "Run As" for SpringBoot to start the project

2. By typing "npm run dev" for nextJs in Front-End


### Break down into end to end tests
 

1. User authentication: Test the user authentication flow, including logging in with valid and invalid credentials, session management, and logout functionality using the NextAuth.

2. User profile: Test the user profile functionality, including editing user information, uploading profile pictures, and viewing other users' profiles.

3. Posting and commenting: Test the ability to create posts and comments, including the display of posts and comments in the user's feed, and the ability to delete or edit posts and comments.

4. Search functionality: Test the ability to search for users, posts, and other content within the application.

5. Status: Test the status whether user is online or offline mode.

Integration with external APIs: Test any integrations with external APIs, such as payment gateways, email providers, or social media platforms.

When breaking down into end-to-end tests, it's important to prioritize the most critical user flows and scenarios, and to ensure that each test covers a specific user action or interaction. By testing the application end-to-end, you can ensure that the entire application is functioning as expected and that users can successfully complete the tasks they need to accomplish.
